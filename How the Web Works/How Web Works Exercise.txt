Part One: Solidify Terminology
1. HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol): HTTP defines the rules for how information gets sent back and forth, specifically, what kind of information can be requested, how it's formatted, and how responses are sent.

2. URL (Uniform Resource Locator):  This is the web address you type into your browser. It tells your computer exactly where to find a specific resource online, such as a webpage, image, or video.

3. DNS (Domain Name System):  Think of DNS as a giant phonebook for the internet. It translates those easy-to-remember website names (like "google.com") into the actual numerical addresses computers use (like 172.217.19.164).

4. Query String:  This is the part of a URL that comes after a question mark (?). It's used to send specific information to a webpage, including search terms or filters. 

5. HTTP Verbs:
- GET: This verb is used to retrieve a specific resource (like a webpage).
- POST: This verb is used for sending information. It's used to submit data to a server, when you fill out a form online.

6. HTTP Request: This is the message your browser sends to the server using the HTTP language. It includes the URL, the verb, and any additional information needed.

7. HTTP Response: This is the reply message the server sends back to your browser after receiving the request. It contains the requested data (such as a webpage) or an error message if something went wrong.

8. HTTP Header:  Think of headers as additional information attached to both requests and responses. They provide details about the content being sent or received.

Request Header Examples: User-Agent, Accept-Language, Cookie, Authorization, Accept-Encoding
Response Header Examples: Content-Type, Content-Length, Status Code, Location, ETag

9. Process When You Type a URL:

- DNS Lookup: Your computer uses DNS to translate “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into the server's numerical IP address.
- HTTP Request: Your browser sends an HTTP request with the GET verb and the full URL to the server.
- Server Response: The server processes the request, retrieves "some/page.html", and sends an HTTP response back to your browser.
- Displaying the Page: Your browser receives the response, understands the content type (likely HTML), and renders the webpage on your screen.
